1. **Total Calls** – Overall number of call records.
2. **% Answered** – Percentage of calls that were successfully answered.
3. **% Resolved of Answered** – Percentage of answered calls that were resolved.
4. **Average Time to Answer Calls** – Mean time (in seconds) taken to answer a call.
5. **Average Talk Duration** – Average talk time across all answered calls.
6. **Average Satisfaction Score (out of 5)** – Mean satisfaction score for all answered and rated calls.

## 📊 Visuals and Insights in Power BI Dashboard

A Power BI dashboard has been created to visualize and interact with the data. Key elements include:

- **Colorful KPI cards** to show top-level metrics.
- A **column chart** showing the count of answered calls grouped by satisfaction rating.
- A **summary table by agent** including:
  - % Answered
  - % Resolved of Answered
  - Average time to answer
  - Average satisfaction score

The visualizations help identify top-performing agents and customer satisfaction trends.
